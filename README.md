Python code to predict Amazon stock price


Yahoo finance page is scraped to get Amazon’s stock price for month of July,2017 using beautifulSoup. Using Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-learn modules I have developed the code to predict Amazon’s present day stock price based on one month historical data. MatplotLib is used to plot the graphs.
